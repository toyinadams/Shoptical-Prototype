# Shoptical-Prototype
Online store front design project with basic UI. 
The application simulates a store view and its basic functionality with no endpoints.
A user can browse through a selection of eyeglass frames of varying colours and add to their cart from a simulated inventory. Once the users checkouts, their receipt will be displayed and the application will terminate.
